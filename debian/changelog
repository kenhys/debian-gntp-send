  * Initial upload to Debian (Closes: #829331)
  * debian/changelog
    - Removed past release changelog entries which are originally
      maintained by Yasuhiro Matsumoto who is upstream author of
      gntp-send. Those entries are just maintained to provide
      packages on Launchpad PPA.
      ref. https://launchpad.net/~mattn/+archive/ubuntu/gntp-send
  * debian/watch
    - Supported to watch upstream.

    - Added metadata about gntp-send package
  * debian/rules

    - Supported multiarch.
  * debian/control
    - Removed needless dependency to autotools-dev because debhelper
      9.20160114 requires it.
